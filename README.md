Nonstandard Template Library (NTL)
==================================

This is a little toy project for me to expiriment with TDD, and C++.
Using [Catch]() as the testing framework, I plan to implement a subset of the C++ [Standard Template Library]().
This will include data structures such as `vector`, `string`, `map`, `list`, algorithms such as `sort`, and others.
This is a pet project, again, to get hands-on with TDD, C++, and all the stuff I forgot from CS 1501.
It's not unlikely that I will add other containers and algorithms not found in the STL, such as red-black trees, and a generic `graph` container, along with a few standard algorithms on it.
Also note that I plan to do this in a C++11 (maybe even 17) style, including smart pointers, range-for, lambdas, etc, where appropriate.
